# Bubble Trouble: Mind the numbers, Beat the clock.

➥ It is a reflexive game that works on matching bubbles to the target number for a challenging and engaging experience.
➥ It has three difficulty levels - Easy (120s), Medium (90s), and Hard (60s) to suit your skill level.
➥ The randomness of the numbered bubbles increase as the difficulty level increases. In hard level, a wrong hit deducts 5 points from the current score.
